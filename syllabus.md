## Quantitative Economic Modeling with Data Science Applications

- **Instructor:** Philip Solimine, philip.solimine@ubc.ca
- **TA:** Joshua Catalano, jcatal@student.ubc.ca
- **Textbook:** [QuantEcon DataScience](https://datascience.quantecon.org/)


## Course Overview
This is a course introducing the computational and data science tools used in modern economics.

We will apply a programming language (Python) to analyze these sorts of
data and making numerical calculations/simulations of models in economics.

The classes will be held at **LASR 104** on Tuesday and Thursday, 12:30-1:50pm. These schedules will be subject to changes in related UBC policies.

## Statement on Academic Honesty:

It is the policy of the VSE to report all violations of UBC’s standards for academic integrity to the office of the Dean of Arts. You are personally responsible for knowing the behaviours that are considered a violation of UBC’s policies for academic honesty found here: https://www.calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=3,54,111,0. To help you understand these rules, every student in this course will complete a module on “Avoiding Academic Misconduct” in the first week of the term. Any student who violates the rules for academic conduct on submitted work will be given an automatic grade of zero on that component of the course. Further penalties may be levied by the President's Advisory Committee on Student Discipline. Those penalties might include a notation on your transcript indicating that you have committed an academic offence, failure of the course, and/or suspension from the university. You can see more on this process, including a complete list of annual academic discipline cases, here: https://universitycounsel.ubc.ca/homepage/guides-and-resources/discipline/. Speak to your instructor if you have any questions regarding the standard for academic integrity at UBC.

## VSE Policy Prohibiting the Hiring of Tutors:

The Vancouver School of Economics expressly prohibits any student from hiring a tutor/editor to assist with any portion of written work or academic research. Violation of this rule will be treated as academic misconduct, and the student will face the same penalties as described above. If at any point you feel in need of additional writing support, please speak with your instructor and/or arrange for a writing consultation with UBC’s Centre for Writing and Scholarly Communication (https://writing.library.ubc.ca/).

## Academic Concessions:

Students at UBC are granted academic concessions for graded work and exams that are missed due to unexpected circumstances. There are only three grounds for academic concessions: unexpected changes in personal responsibilities; medical circumstances; and compassionate grounds. A detailed description of each can be found here: https://students.ubc.ca/enrolment/academic-learning-resources/academic-concessions. Situations that are expected (such as time constraints due to workload in other courses) or are predictable (such as being scheduled for paid work) are not grounds for academic concession. It is expected that requests for academic concession will be made before the due date for that graded work and/or the writing of the exam. Note that UBC policy does not allow for concessions to students who have missed work because they have registered for a course after the due date for that work. Students in the Faculty of Arts who require a concession should apply for a concession using this form: https://students.air.arts.ubc.ca/academic-concession-form/. Students in other Faculties should consult their Faculty website on academic concessions and consult with their instructor.

## Student Success:

UBC provides resources to support student learning and to maintain healthy lifestyles but recognizes that sometimes crises arise and so there are additional resources to access including those for survivors of sexual violence. UBC values respect for the person and ideas of all members of the academic community. Harassment and discrimination are not tolerated nor is suppression of academic freedom. UBC provides appropriate accommodation for students with disabilities and for religious, spiritual and cultural observances. UBC values academic honesty and students are expected to acknowledge the ideas generated by others and to uphold the highest academic standards in all of their actions. Details of the policies and how to access support are available here: https://senate.ubc.ca/policies-resources-support-student-success/.
